OOPSconepts : OOPS is a programing paradigm that is based on the concept of 
              objects rather than just functions  and procedures, 
              it is the most popular methodology among developers. 

              OOPs stands for object oriented programing. it is a programing paradigm that

                          the main Purpose of OOP is to binding together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code
                          can access this data expect this fuction.

                          Above code is an example of ‘classes’. Classes are the blueprints of objects. Classes are the programmer-defined data type, which includes the local methods and the local variables. Class is a collection of objects which has properties and behaviour.
